Things that need to be done:
-   Write some documentation files/make a documentation dir.
-   Add a platform method to open/read/write files from paths. Maybe also a native file selector option?
-   Add self closing tags.
-   Debug linux weirdness with image tiles showing neighbouring pixels. Potential rounding error?
-   Add mip mapping to the font/image atlases.
-   Remove current style class/selector system and replace it so that elements can have only 1 class attribute with 1
    class named in it and NO bindings. This allows us to bake down styles at compile time. Each style can then also have
    its possible selectors (i.e. !hovered/!mousedown) baked into it. This simplifies runtime alot since all it then needs
    to do is combine the element style with the class style once afer which we can cache it. For dynamic changes the user
    calls the SetColor() etc functions which modify a specific element's cached version of the style. Maybe we also add
    a OverrideStyle() function which allows the user to dynamically change style attributes for all the elements with 
    that style. Alternatively we could have some kind of pointer passing method where users can bind a style to a pointer
    so that all the elements with that class will share the one style.
-   Add a regression test suite.
