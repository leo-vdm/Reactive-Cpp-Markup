Things that need to be done:
1. Add the absolute/relative display modes. Absolute is in relation to the root, relative is in relation to the parent.
   Maybe a 'fixed' mode aswell to mimic HTML which is in relation to screen coordinates. Note that fixed can be used
   to mimic absolute and vice versa with a little math and layoutelement inspection, maybe we only need one? 
2. ArenaString needs an insert function
3. Need to add buffer swapping for the renderque arena since we want to be able to reference the sized elements
   in the next frame. Should also add dom methods for easily searching glyphs at a position to find a clicked glyph
   (mostly for textbox to be able to function)
4. Add the pointer passing mechanic/ a method for components to see their attributes and use custom attributes as 
   arguments.
5. Add self closing tags.
6. Finish the InputBox implementation
7. Change the onFocus callback to a focusChanged callback that gives a bool saying whether the element has become
   focused or been defocused.
8. Debug linux weirdness with image tiles showing neighbouring pixels. Potential rounding error?
